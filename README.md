#One Page Html

The project aims to present HTML5 tags on a single page, providing concise descriptions, code examples, and all relevant attributes for each tag. This allows users to quickly access information when needed. The primary goal of the project is to assist those who want to easily remember and seek support when using HTML5 tags.
